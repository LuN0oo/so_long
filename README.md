*This project has been created has part of the 42 curriculum by analaphi.*

## Description

The project consist of having a working **2D TopDown view game** where you spawn in a map, working you're way up into a "maze" with walls, collectibles, and a exit door. You'll need to have all the collectibles available in the map in order to leave. The subject require to have the possibility to move in the map with the use of your keyboard (WASD), to display in real time the number of move you're at in the terminal, and to be able to do whatever you want on your machine while the game window is opened. It is needed to have the ability to close the window in two different ways without causing error, in this case you can press "ESC" on your keyboard or click on the cross in the right corner of the window. This must not cause any memory leak in any case. 

## Instructions

First, you'll have to download the mlx folder given in the subject page and extract it in my so_long folder. Once this is done, you can 'make' in the root and there will be a new executable **so_long**. To launch the game, execute this command : "./so_long maps/<MAP_YOU_WANT> and now you can enjoy !

## Ressources 

For this project, the subject was really intuitive for me so it was a bit easier that the others projects. I got some help from my friends concerning the mlx implementation and how sprites works with the minilibx, and some Makefile things to compile the MLX and implement my get_next_line into the project.
