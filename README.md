You'll need to have all the collectibles available in the map in order to leave. The subject require to have the possibility to move in the map with the use of your keyboard (WASD), to display in real time the number of move you're at in the terminal, and to be able to do whatever you want on your machine while the game window is opened. It is needed to have the ability to close the window in two different ways without causing error, in this case you can press "ESC" on your keyboard or click on the cross in the right corner of the window. This must not cause any memory leak in any case.
